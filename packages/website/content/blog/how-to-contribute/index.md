Contributing to FrontendChallenges is a great way to get involved in the open source community, but it can be very daunting. This guide will help you get started with contributing to FrontendChallenges.

## Found a Bug?

If you notice something that does not work how it should, whether that be:
- Spelling
- Accessibility
- SEO

or anything else, then please do [create an issue](https://github.com/jsartisan/frontend-challenges/issues/new/choose).

Once an issue has been created, We will review it and then pick it up as soon as possible. 

## Want to add a Question?

There are two ways to add a question to FrontendChallenges.

1. Go to the [submission page](https://frontend-challenges.com/submit) and fill out the form. This will create a new issue on GitHub. Behind the sceeen, our github workflows will then create a new branch and pull request for it. This will then be reviewed and merged into the main branch.
2. Fork the repository, create a new branch, add your question to the `questions` folder and then create a pull request. This will then be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

Obviously Option #1 is much easier, but the choice is yours.

### Pull Request Feedback

Since all pull requests needs to be reviewed before being merged into main branch, which does mean that on occasion there will be feedback. Please do not be disheartened by feedback, we're all developing each other's skill set and trying to make FrontendChallenges (and other open source projects) better.

### Getting FrontendChallenges Locally

FrontendChallenges is a Next JS + Typescript project and can be set up quickly with the following commands.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jsartisan/frontend-challenges.git
npm install
npm run dev
```
