We have a input component that triggers a re-render with every keystroke.

But the problem is that on every re-render of Input, the highlight state of ComponentWithState is lost. Try clicking the ComponentWithState component and then start typing in the Input. You will notice that highlight state is getting lost. Why?

What can you do to fix it?
