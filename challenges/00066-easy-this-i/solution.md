**Question:**

The `createUser` function returns an object.

What happens when we try to access its `ref` property? Why?

```javascript
function createUser() {
  return {
    name: "John Doe",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = createUser();

alert(user.ref.name); // What's the result?
```

**Solution:**

The result is an error.

```javascript
function createUser() {
  return {
    name: "John Doe",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = createUser();

alert(user.ref.name); 
// Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

This occurs because the rules governing `this` do not consider object definitions. Instead, they depend on the moment of function invocation.

Within the `createUser()` function, the value of `this` is `undefined` because it is invoked as a function, not as a method with dot syntax.

The value of `this` remains consistent throughout the entire function, unaffected by code blocks or object literals. Therefore, `ref: this` captures the current `this` of the function.

We can rewrite the function to explicitly return `this`:

```javascript
function createUser(){
  return this; // In this version, there's no object literal
}

alert(createUser().name); 
// Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

Notice that the result of `alert(createUser().name)` mirrors the outcome of `alert(user.ref.name)` from the previous example.

Alternatively, when `ref` is defined as a method, `this` is properly bound:

```javascript
function createUser() {
  return {
    name: "John Doe",
    ref() {
      return this;
    }
  };
}

let user = createUser();

alert(user.ref().name); // John Doe
```

Here, `user.ref()` acts as a method, and `this` is correctly set to the object before the dot.
