Let me explain the execution order of this code:

The output will be: `1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 6, 9, 8`

Here's why:

1. First, synchronous code executes:
   - `console.log(1)` executes first
   - Promise constructor executes synchronously, so `console.log(2)` and `console.log(3)` run next
   - `console.log(4)` runs next
   - `console.log(7)` runs after that

2. Then microtasks (Promise callbacks) execute:
   - First `.then()` executes, printing `console.log(5)`
   - Second `.then()` executes, printing `console.log(6)`

3. Finally, macrotasks (setTimeout callbacks) execute:
   - `setTimeout` with 0ms delay prints `console.log(9)`
   - `setTimeout` with 10ms delay prints `console.log(8)`

**Key points to understand**:
- Promise constructor runs synchronously
- Promise `.then()` callbacks are microtasks and execute after all synchronous code but before macrotasks
- `setTimeout` callbacks are macrotasks and execute after microtasks
- Between two `setTimeout`, the one with shorter delay executes first (0ms vs 10ms)
