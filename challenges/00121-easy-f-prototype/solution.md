The output will be:
```
true
true
false
```

- `rabbit1.eats` logs `true` because `rabbit1` is created when `Rabbit.prototype` has `eats` set to `true`.
- `rabbit1.eats` logs `true` again because reassigning `Rabbit.prototype` creates a new prototype object but does not affect existing instances.
- `rabbit2.eats` logs `false` because `rabbit2` is created after `Rabbit.prototype` is reassigned to a new object with `eats` set to `false`.
