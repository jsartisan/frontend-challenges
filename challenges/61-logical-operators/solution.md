The console output will be:

```
""
1
```

In the code snippet, we are using the logical AND (`&&`) and logical OR (`||`) operators to evaluate expressions involving variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

1. **Logical AND (`&&`) Operation:**

   - The `&&` operator returns the first falsy value it encounters, or the last value if all values are truthy.
   - Here's how `a && b && c` is evaluated:
     - `a` is `1`, which is truthy.
     - `b` is `""`, which is falsy.
     - `c` is `0`, which is falsy.
     - Therefore, `a && b && c` evaluates to the first falsy value encountered, which is `""`.
     - So, `console.log(a && b && c);` logs `""`.

2. **Logical OR (`||`) Operation:**
   - The `||` operator returns the first truthy value it encounters, or the last value if all values are falsy.
   - Here's how `a || b || c` is evaluated:
     - `a` is `1`, which is truthy.
     - `b` is `""`, which is falsy.
     - `c` is `0`, which is falsy.
     - Therefore, `a || b || c` evaluates to the first truthy value encountered, which is `1`.
     - So, `console.log(a || b || c);` logs `1`.
