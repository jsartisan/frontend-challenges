One common UI element found in many web applications is a checkbox. While HTML provides a built-in checkbox element, sometimes we need to create custom checkboxes to better suit the design or functionality requirements of our application.

Create a custom checkbox component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The component should have the following features:

- Display a custom checkbox icon. 
- Allow toggling between checked and unchecked states when clicked.
- Allow states like hover, focus, intermediate and disabled.
- Allow `small`, `medium` and `large` size variants.
